\chapter{Introduction to Real Analysis}
\epigraph{Rarely is a picture a proof, but I hope a good picture will cement your understanding of why something is true. Seeing is believing.}
{---Charles C. Pugh, \cite{pugh-analysis}}
In this chapter, we introduce the ideas of real analysis, which is the study of the real numbers. In some sense, real analysis is a rigorization of calculus, so we will spend our time discussing notions of limits of sequences and functions. We conclude the chapter by discussing the real numbers in more formality.
