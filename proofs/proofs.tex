\chapter{Writing Proofs}
\epigraph{So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them.}
{---Joseph Jacobs, ``The Story of the Three Little Pigs'' \cite{english-fairy-tales}}
In this chapter, we use the set-theoretic foundation we have built to begin properly introducing proof-writing. The previous chapter has already introduced the notion of proof as an explanation of why something is true, so in this chapter we expand on this notion. As usual, our focus will lie with examples.
