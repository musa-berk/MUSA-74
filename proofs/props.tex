\section{Week \theweek: Propositional Logic}
Before we jump into proof techniques, let us first introduce propositional logic. Propositional logic is the foundation of all mathematics. It allows us to construct correct mathematical arguments and with a strong understanding of logic, one's ability to break down and solve problems will improve immensely. 
\begin{definition}[proposition]
    A \dfn{proposition} is a declarative sentence, which declares a fact. Note that this fact can either be true or false, but not both. 
\end{definition}
Let us go over a couple examples. 
\begin{example}
    Which of the following are propositions and which are not? 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item I like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
        \item Pigs can fly and talk.
        \item Can you see the pineapple wearing sunglasses?
        \item $9 + 10 = 21$.
        \item $5 + 5 = 10$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    Sentences (a), (b), (d), and (e) are propositions. Sentence (c) is not a proposition. Can you think of why sentence (c) is not a proposition? Note that although (b) and (d) are not true, they are still propositions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Compound Propositions}
Here are a few definitions.
\begin{definition}[propositional variable]
    A \dfn{propositional variable} (also called a \dfn{sentential variable}) is a variable that is assigned to a \dfn{truth value} (true or false). 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[primitive proposition]
    A \dfn{primitive proposition} is a proposition that can't be further broken down. 
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    The following are examples of primitive proposition examples.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item It is sunny outside.
        \item It is raining.
        \item I am tired.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{definition}[compound proposition]
    A \dfn{compound proposition} is a proposition that can be further broken down into primitive propositions. Compound propositions consist of one or more primitive (or compound) propositions joined by \dfn{logical operators}.
\end{definition}
Negation (NOT), conjunction (AND), disjunction (NOR), exclusive-OR (XOR), implication (conditional statement: if \ldots{} then \ldots), and equivalence (\ldots{} if and only if \ldots) are logical operators. We will explore these operators in more detail over the next few lectures. Note that propositional variables can also be used to represent compound propositions.
\begin{exercise}
Which of the following are compound propositions? 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Bob likes PB\&J sandwiches. 
        \item Bob likes peanut butter sandwiches and he likes jelly sandwiches.
        \item Alice has at least $20$ pigs.
        \item Alice likes ice-cream or cookies, but not both. 
        \item Tom failed his math test. 
        \item If it is sunny outside then we will go to the beach. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
Here are our first logical operators.
\begin{definition}[negation]
    Let $p$ be a proposition. The \dfn{negation} of $p$ is the statement ``not $p$'' or ``it is not the case that $p$''. We denote the negation of p using $\neg p$, $ -p$, $p'$, ${\sim}p$, $!p$, \ldots but they all mean the same and you can use any symbol. 
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
    What is the negation of each of the following propositions?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Alice likes ice-cream or cookies
        \item Bob has at least $20$ pigs.
        \item The pineapple is not wearing sunglasses.
        \item $9 + 10 = 21$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{definition}[logical conjunction]
    Let $p$ and $q$ be propositional variables. The \dfn{conjunction} of $p$ and $q$ is the statement ``$p$ and $q$''. We denote the conjunction of $p$ and $q$ by $p \land q$. Note that the conjunction $ p \land q$ has a truth value of true when both are true; otherwise, the truth value is false. 
\end{definition} 
\begin{definition}[logical disjunction]
    Let $p$ and $q$ be propositional variables. The \dfn{disjunction} of $p$ and $q$ is the statement ``$p$ or $q$''. We denote the disjunction of $p$ and $q$ by $p \lor q$. Note that the conjunction $ p \lor q$ has a truth value of false when both are false; otherwise, the truth value is true. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[exclusive disjunction]
    Let $p$ and $q$ be propositional variables. The \dfn{exclusive disjunction} of $p$ and $q$ is the statement ``$p$ or $q$, but not both''. We denote the exclusive disjunction of $p$ and $q$ by $p \oplus q$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[conditional statement]
    Let p and q be propositions. A \dfn{conditional statement}, symbolized by $p \rightarrow q$, is the statement ``if $p$, then $q$''. Note that $ p \rightarrow q$ is false when p is true and q is false; otherwise, the truth value is true. 
\end{definition}
There are many different ways to say something like $p\to q$. Here is a quick table, for reference.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ c|c } 
    ``if $p$, then $q$'' & ``$p$ implies $q$'' \\
    ``if $p$, then $q$'' & ``$p$ only if $q$'' \\
    ``$p$ is sufficient for $q$'' & ``a sufficient condition for $q$ is $p$'' \\
    ``$q$ if $p$'' & ``$q$ whenever $p$'' \\
    ``$q$ when $p$'' &  ``$q$ is necessary for $p$'' \\
    ``a necessary condition for $p$ is $q$'' & â€œ$q$ follows from $p$'' \\
    ``$q$ unless $\lnot p$'' & ``q provided that p''
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Truth Tables} 
Truth tables are utilized to keep track of all possible truth values of a compound proposition. Let's see some examples.
\begin{example}
    Let $p$ be a proposition. Here is the truth table for $\lnot p$.
    \[\begin{array}{ c|c }
        p & \neg p\\\hline
        \text{T} & \text{F} \\
        \text{F} & \text{T} \\
    \end{array}\]
\end{example}
\begin{exercise}
    Construct a truth table for each of the following compound propositions.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item $p \land q$
        \item $p \lor q$
        \item $p \oplus q$
        \item $p \land \neg q$
        \item $p \land q \land r$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
Let's do some more examples! 
\begin{exercise}
    Write these statements using $p$ and $q$. Remember to define the propositions $p$ and $q$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item If I study really hard for this course, then I will do well in other upper division math courses. 
        \item The dog is cute unless it is a lion. 
        \item A necessary condition to do well in math is to practice many problems.
        \item If it rains today, I should bring an umbrella.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
% Solve the following puzzle by translating statements into logical expressions and then make conclusions from these expressions with the help of truth tables.
% \begin{exercise}[{\cite[Exercise~1.2.23--27]{rosen}}]
%     Suppose that knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. Now suppose you encounter two people $A$ and $B$. If $A$ is either a knight or a knave, and $B$ is either a knight or a knave, what conclusions can you draw from each of the following (indepedent) scenarios? When possible, determine the identity (knave or knight) of $A$ and $B$.
%     % Note: Each scenario is independent from the other scenarios. For some of the scenarios it may not be possible to determine the identity of A and B, but you will be able to draw some conclusions.
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%         \item $A$ says ``At least one of us is a knave'' and $B$ says nothing. 
%         \item $A$ says ``The two of us are both knights,'' and $B$ says ``$A$ is a knave.''
%         \item $A$ says ``I am a knave or $B$ is a knight'' and B says nothing. 
%         \item Both $A$ and $B$ say ``I'm a knight.''
%         \item $A$ says ``We are both knaves,'' and $B$ says nothing. 
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{exercise}

% \subsection{Problems}
% % \noindent \textit{The following problems can be found in Kenneth H. Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications Eighth Edition. }
% Solve the following puzzle by translating statements into logical expressions and then make conclusions from these expressions with the help of truth tables. Show your work!
% \begin{homework}[{\cite[Exercise~1.2.36]{rosen}}]
%     The police have three suspects for the murder of Mr. Cooper: Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Williams. Smith, Jones, and Williams each declare that they did not kill Cooper. Smith also states that Cooper was a friend of Jones and that Williams disliked him. Jones also states that he did not know Cooper and that he was out of town the day Cooper was killed. Williams also states that he saw both Smith and Jones with Cooper the day of the killing and that either Smith or Jones must have killed him.
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%         \item Can you determine who the murderer was if we know that one of the three men is guilty, the two innocent men are telling the truth, but the statements of the guilty man may or may not be true? 
%         \item Can you determine who the murderer was if we know that innocent men do not lie? 
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{homework}

\subsection{Logical Equivalences}
Some propositions are particularly simple because they are either always true or always false.
\begin{definition}[tautology]
    A \dfn{tautology} is a compound proposition that is always true, regardless of whether the truth values of the proposition variables are true or false. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[contradiction]
    A \dfn{contradiction} is a compound proposition that is always false regardless of whether the truth values of the proposition variables used to construct the compound proposition are true or false.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let $p$ and $q$ be propositional variables. For each compound proposition below, determine whether the proposition is a tautology, a contradiction, or neither. 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item $p \land \neg q$
        \item $p \land \neg p$
        \item The temperature is $32$ degrees Fahrenheit and $0$ degrees Celsius.
        \item The temperature is $32$ degrees Fahrenheit or not $0$ degrees Celsius.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    Here, (d) is a tautology, (b) is a contradiction, and (a) and (c) are neither.
% Tautologies: $\# 4$ \\
% Contradictions: $\# 2$ \\
% Neither: $\# 1$, $\# 3$ 
\end{proof}
Even if two propositions are not both always true, they might still ``mean the same thing.'' In propositional logic, this notion is called logical equivalence.
\begin{definition}[logical equivalence]
    Let $p$ and $q$ be compound propositions. We say that $p$ and $q$ are \dfn{logically equivalent}, denoted as $p \equiv q$, if and only if $p \rightarrow q$ and $q \rightarrow p$ are both always true. Equivalently, $p\equiv q$ if and only if $p$ is true exactly when $q$ is true.
\end{definition}
\begin{example} \label{exe:logical-conditional}
    Let $p$ and $q$ be proposition variables. Show that $p \rightarrow q  \equiv \neg p \lor q$ using a truth table.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    We build a truth table, as follows.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
            $p$ & $q$ & $p\to q$ & $\lnot p\lor q$ \\\hline
            T & T & T & T \\
            T & F & F & F \\
            F & T & T & T \\
            F & F & T & T
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Note the $p\to q$ column is true exactly when the $\lnot p\lor q$ column is true.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
    Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be proposition variables. Show that $(p \lor q) \lor r \equiv p \lor (q \lor r)$ using a truth table.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    We build a truth table, as follows.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
             $p$ & $q$ & $r$ & $p \lor q$ & $q \lor r$ & $(p \lor q) \lor r$ & $p \lor (q \lor r)$  \\
             \hline
             T & T & T & T &  T & T & T \\
             T & T & F & T &  T & T & T \\
             T & F & T & T &  T & T & T \\
             T & F & F & T &  F & T & T \\
             F & T & T & T &  T & T & T \\
             F & T & F & T &  T & T & T \\
             F & F & T & F &  T & T & T \\
             F & F & F & F &  F & F & F \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Note the $(p\lor q)\lor r$ column is true exactly when the $p\lor(q\lor r)$ column is true.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}[contraposition] \label{ex:contraposition}
    Let $p$ and $q$ be proposition variables. Show that $(p\to q)\equiv(\lnot q\to\lnot p)$ using a truth table.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    We build a truth table, as follows.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c||c|c}
            $p$ & $q$ & $\lnot p$ & $\lnot q$ & $p\to q$ & $\lnot q\to\lnot p$ \\\hline
            T & T & F & F & T & T \\
            T & F & F & T & F & F \\
            F & T & T & F & T & T \\
            F & F & T & T & T & T
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Note the $p\to q$ column is true exactly when the $\lnot q\to\lnot p$ column is true.
\end{proof}
% We take a moment to record the most important equivalences and their names. Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be proposition variables.

%     $ p \lor \neg p \equiv\text T$ & Negation Laws \\
%     $ p \land \neg p \equiv\text F$ &
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% Let's see these in action.
% \begin{example} \label{exe:better-arrow}
%     Let $p$ and $q$ be proposition variables. Show that $\neg(p \rightarrow q)  \equiv p \land \neg q$ using a series of logical equivalences. 
% \end{example}
% \begin{proof}
%     By De Morgan's Laws, we have that $\neg (\neg p \lor q) \equiv \neg (\neg p) \land \neg q$. By the Double Negation Law, we know that $\neg (\neg p) \land \neg q \equiv  p \land \neg q.$ Considering that $p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg p \lor q$ by \Cref{exe:logical-conditional}, we can say that  $\neg(p \rightarrow q) \equiv \neg(\neg p \lor q) \equiv p \land \neg q.$
% \end{proof}
% \begin{example}
%     Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be proposition variables. Show that $(p \land q) \rightarrow (p \lor q )$ is a tautology using a series of logical equivalences.
% \end{example}
% \begin{proof}
%     Let $u \equiv p \land q$ and $w \equiv p \lor q$. We want to show that $u \rightarrow w$. By \Cref{exe:better-arrow}, we know that $u \rightarrow w \equiv \neg u \lor w.$ So we have that $(p \land q) \rightarrow (p \lor q ) \equiv \neg(p \land q) \lor (p \lor q )$. We now have the equivalences
%     \begin{align*}
%         (p \land q) \rightarrow (p \lor q ) &\equiv (\neg p \lor \neg q) \lor (p \lor q ) \tag{De Morgan's Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \neg p \lor (\neg q \lor (p \lor q )) \tag{Associative Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \neg p \lor ( (p \lor q )\lor \neg q) \tag{Commutative Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \neg p \lor ( p \lor (q \lor \neg q)) \tag{Associative Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \neg p \lor ( p \lor \text{T}) \tag{Negation Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \neg p \lor \text{T} \tag{Negation Laws} \\
%         &\equiv \text{T} \tag{Negation Laws},
%     \end{align*}
%     which complete the proof.
% \end{proof}
% \begin{example}[contraposition] \label{exe:contraposition}
%     Let $p$ and $q$ be proposition variables. Show that $(p\to q)\equiv(\lnot q\to\lnot p)$ using a series of logical equivalences. The proposition $\lnot q\to\lnot p$ is called the \dfn{contraposition} of the proposition $p\to q$.
% \end{example}
% \begin{proof}
%     The main point is to use \Cref{exe:logical-conditional} to see $(p\to q)\equiv(\lnot p\lor q)$ and $(\lnot q\to\lnot p)\equiv(\lnot\lnot q\lor\lnot p)$. Thus, we compute
%     \begin{align*}
%         \lnot q\to\lnot p &\equiv \lnot\lnot q\lor\lnot p \\
%         &\equiv q\lor\lnot p \tag{Double Negation Law} \\
%         &\equiv \lnot p\lor q \tag{Commutative Laws} \\
%         &\equiv p\to q,
%     \end{align*}
%     which completes the proof.
% \end{proof}


% \subsection{Propositional Functions}
% Thus far we have built an intuition that a proposition like $p\land q$ takes in truth values according to $p$ and $q$ and then gives back the truth value of $p\land q$. This notion can be generalized, as follows.
% \begin{definition}[propositional function]
%     An \textit{$n$-ary propositional function}\nirindex{n-ary propositional function@$n$-ary propositional function} $P$ is a function that maps the $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ to either true or false (exclusive). Note $P$ is often called the \dfn{predicate} and the evaluation of $P$ at $(x_1, \ldots,x_n)$ is $P(x_1, \ldots,x_n)$.
% \end{definition}
% Here are some examples.
% \begin{example}
%     Let $\RR$ denote the set of real numbers. Define $P\colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \{\text T,\text F \}$ by
%     \[P(x)\coloneqq\begin{cases}
%         \text T & \text{if } x > 3, \\
%         \text F & \text{if } x \leq 3.
%     \end{cases}\]
% \end{example}
% \begin{example}
%     Let $\RR$ denote the set of ordered pairs of real numbers. Define $P\colon \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \{\text T,\text F \}$ by
%     \[P(x,y)\coloneqq\begin{cases}
%         \text T & \text{if } x > y,\\
%         \text F & \text{if } x \leq y.
%     \end{cases}\]
% \end{example}
% \begin{example} \label{ex:musa-74-function}
%     Define $P\colon \{\text{UC Berkeley Students}\} \rightarrow \{\text T,\text F \}$ by
%     \[P(x)\coloneqq\begin{cases}
%         \text T & \text{if $x$ is enrolled in MUSA 74},\\
%         \text F & \text{if $x$ is NOT enrolled in MUSA 74}.
%     \end{cases}\]
% \end{example}
% As we can see from the above examples, a propositional function maps to a proposition, but the propositional function itself is not a proposition. For example, consider \Cref{ex:musa-74-function}. Let Bob be a UC Berkeley student. The truth table below shows us that $P(\text{Bob})$ is equivalent to the proposition: Bob is enrolled in MUSA 74.
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tabular}{c|c}
%          Bob is enrolled in MUSA 74 & $P(\text{Bob})$ \\
%          \hline
%          T & T \\
%          F & F \\
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{center}

\subsection{Quantifiers}
What if we want to create a proposition from our propositional function without an argument? {Quantifiers} allow us to do exactly that!
\begin{definition}[universal quantification]
    Let $P\colon S \rightarrow \{\text T,\text F\}$ be a propositional function. The \dfn{universal quantification} of $P$ is the proposition ``$P(x)$ for all $x $ in $S$''. The notation $\forall xP(x)$ denotes the universal quantification of P where $\forall$ represents ``for all''. Note $\forall xP(x)$ is true when $P(x)$ is true for all $x \in S$; otherwise, $\forall x P(x)$ is false.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[existential quantification]
    Let $P\colon S \rightarrow \{\text T,\text F\}$ be a propositional function. The \dfn{existential quantification} of $P$ is the proposition ``there exists an element $x$ in $S$ such that $P(x)$''. The notation $\exists x P(x)$ denotes the existential quantification of $P$ where $\exists $ represents ``there exists''. Note $\exists x P(x)$ is true when $P(x)$ is true for some $x$ in $S$. If there doesn't exist an $x$ in $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true then $\exists x P(x)$ is false.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Considering that a combination of quantifiers and propositional functions are utilized to represent a wide range of statements found in both mathematics and in the English language (as well as all other languages for that matter), most propositions constructed using quantifiers and propositional functions have somewhat "less formal" language to express quantifiers. For example, instead of saying ``for all the marbles x in the bag, x is blue'', we can say ``all of the marbles in the bag are blue''. 
\end{remark}
It is important to remember that $\forall x P(x)$ and $\exists x P(x)$ are propositions, so we can treat them as such.
\begin{example}
    Express the following statements using propositional functions and quantifiers.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Some cats have richly colored fur. 
        \item All cats are domesticated. 
        \item No felines that are larger than the average human are domesticated.
        \item Felines that are not cats are not domesticated.
        \item All felines that are larger than the average human are not cats.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\begin{proof} 
    Let $P, Q, R, S\colon \{\text{all felines}\} \rightarrow \{\text T, \text F \}$ be propositional functions. Let $P(x)$ be the statement ``$x$ is a cat'' and $Q(x)$ be the statement ``$x$ is larger than the average human''. Let $R(x)$ be the statement ``$x$ is domesticated'' and $S(x)$ be the statement ``$x$ has richly colored fur''.

Let $P$ and $Q$ be propositional functions. The following tables include commonly used propositions with quantifiers (and nested quantifiers) along with information on how to determine their truth values.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
        Proposition & Equivalent & True when: & False when: \\
        \hline
        $\forall x P(x)$ && $P(x)$ is true for all x & There exists an $x$ for which\\
        &&& $P(x)$ is false \\
        \hline
        $\exists x P(x)$ && There exists an $x$ for which & $P(x)$ is false for all $x$ \\
        && $P(x)$ is true & \\
        \hline
        $\neg \exists x P(x)$ & $\forall x \neg P(x)$ & For every $x$, $P(x)$ is false & There is some $x$ \\
        & & & for which $P(x)$ is true  \\  
        \hline
        $\neg \forall x P(x)$ & $\exists x \neg P(x)$ & There is some $x$ & $P(x)$ is true for all $x$ \\
         & & for which $P(x)$ is false &

We note that we can even nest our quantifiers! Here is the corresponding table.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    Proposition & True when: & False when: \\
    \hline
    $\forall x \forall y Q(x,y)$ & $Q(x, y)$ is true for every pair $x$, $y$ & There is a pair $x$, $y$  \\
    $\forall y \forall x Q(x,y)$ & & for which $Q(x, y)$ is false \\
    \hline
     $\forall x \exists y Q(x,y)$ & For every $x$, there is some $y$ & There is some $x$ for which \\
     & for which $Q(x, y)$ is true & $Q(x,y)$ is false for every $y$\\
     \hline
     $\exists x \forall y Q(x,y)$ & There is some $x$ for which & For every $x$ there is some \\
     & $Q(x,y)$ is true for every $y$ & $y$ for which $Q(x,y)$ is false\\
     \hline
     $\exists x \exists y Q(x,y)$ & There is a pair $x$, $y$ & $Q(x, y)$ is false for every pair $x$, $y$  \\
    $\exists y \exists x Q(x,y)$ &  for which $Q(x, y)$ is true & \\
