\chapter{Cardinality of Sets}
\epigraph{Set theorists are the fun police of math.}
{---Bryce Goldman}
Now that we have some proof-writing skills at our fingertips, we return to the set theory that we began these notes with and prove some interesting theorems about them. Our focus in his chapter is on we compare sizes of sets. This is harder than it looks, especially when trying to compare sizes of sets which need not be finite!
