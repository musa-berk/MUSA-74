\chapter{The Language of Set Theory}
\epigraph{The Lord said, ``If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.''}
{---Genesis 11:6, NIV}

Set theory underpins the vast majority of modern mathematics, and is a crucial component of almost any proof you will encounter in any upper division course. The language of set theory provides us with a framework to formalize many mathematical concepts that we are intuitively familiar with---namely, collections of data and functions between them. Throughout the remainder of this course, and almost certainly beyond it, set theory will be used extensively.
